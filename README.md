# Scripts-and-Tools

## Scripts

Create a repo for any scripts you create in the course of your project.

Include any scripts specified in the Project Requirements document, and any other scripts and tools you create along the way.

All scripts should:

  * Be properly formatted.
 
  * Include header documentation including authorship, script name, purpose, and date.

  * Have the appropriate file extension in the file name. 

- Create a basic README.md file within the repo that contains links to each script. 
 
   * For each script also include:

       - The names of all the members who contributed to the script.

       - A description of the script including the WHAT and WHY.

       - Any resources or references used in creating the script here as well.

## Project Management Tools

Make sure everyone has access and correct permissions to the tool you are using.

* GitHub Projects

Build out sections to help organize tasks. Try using labels such as:

- “To Do”

- “In Progress”

- “Done” 

- “Stretch Goals”
 
Organize your PM Tool however you think is best for your team! 
Grant the instructor access to your project management tool for review during daily stand-ups.

## Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy with all team members, so everyone is working from the same slideshow.
Link the shared doc in your PM tool.

The presentation should follow exactly from the template slide deck. Ensure your timing is no more than 15 minutes long, including some time at the end for questions.

Each member should introduce themselves with their personal pitch.

Each member of the team must have at least one demo and one speaking part. It is okay to use notes if you are nervous about forgetting what to talk about. Some of the areas to discuss include:

* An introduction of the client company and their requests and needs.

* A demonstration of the solutions with an explanation of the WHAT and WHY behind it.

* A technical obstacle or two and how those obstacles were overcome.

* A portion of the final solution that each team member is particularly proud of.

See the Project Guidelines for list of required components.
