# Scripts-and-Tools

Create a repo for any scripts you create in the course of your project.

Include any scripts specified in the Project Requirements document, and any other scripts and tools you create along the way.

All scripts should:

  * Be properly formatted.
 
  * Include header documentation including authorship, script name, purpose, and date.

  * Have the appropriate file extension in the file name. 

- Create a basic README.md file within the repo that contains links to each script. 
 
   * For each script also include:

       - The names of all the members who contributed to the script.

       - A description of the script including the WHAT and WHY.

       - Any resources or references used in creating the script here as well.
