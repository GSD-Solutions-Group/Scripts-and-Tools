## Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy with all team members, so everyone is working from the same slideshow.
Link the shared doc in your PM tool.

The presentation should follow exactly from the template slide deck. Ensure your timing is no more than 15 minutes long, including some time at the end for questions.

Each member should introduce themselves with their personal pitch.

Each member of the team must have at least one demo and one speaking part. It is okay to use notes if you are nervous about forgetting what to talk about. Some of the areas to discuss include:

* An introduction of the client company and their requests and needs.

* A demonstration of the solutions with an explanation of the WHAT and WHY behind it.

* A technical obstacle or two and how those obstacles were overcome.

* A portion of the final solution that each team member is particularly proud of.

See the Project Guidelines for list of required components.
